<h2>Inclusive Design Institute Workshops</h2>
<p>Are you working to comply with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) Information and Communication Standard? Do you need practical, up-to-date, technical training and support in addressing the goals of the standard? The following workshops provide more than awareness and general principles. Participants will receive practical, hands-on experience and knowledge in addressing technical accessibility barriers and in meeting the requirements of the AODA. Participants will be equipped with resources, tools and references needed to create accessible information and communication systems and practices whether it is a Web service, mobile application, kiosk, online application, form, game, video, animation or interactive map. </p>
